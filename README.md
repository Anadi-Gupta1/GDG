# 📊 GenAI-Powered Personalized Financial Guidance

## 🚨 Problem Statement
### Scaling Personalized Financial Guidance to Hundreds of Millions of Investors

Financial guidance is a critical aspect of personal wealth management, but traditional models are:

- ❌ Expensive due to human advisory fees.
- ❌ Time-consuming with manual consultations.
- ❌ Limited in scalability (1-to-1 human consultations cannot scale to millions of users).
- ❌ Biased due to human intervention.
- ❌ Inefficient in providing **real-time personalized financial insights**.

With **hundreds of millions of investors globally** seeking personalized financial advice, there is a massive gap in providing:

| Challenges                    | Impact                                  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Lack of Real-time Advice      | Delayed decision-making                |
| High Advisory Fees           | Limited Access for Low-Income Groups   |
| Scalability Issues           | Limited reach to mass markets          |
| Biased Recommendations       | Unreliable Investment Guidance        |
| Fragmented Knowledge Sources | Difficulty in Understanding Investments |
